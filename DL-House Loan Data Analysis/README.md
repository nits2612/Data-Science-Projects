# House Loan Data Anaysis

## Project statement:

For a safe and secure lending experience, it's important to analyze the past data. In this project, we will build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans using the historical data. As you will see, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

## Task at Hand:
My job is to analyze the House Loan data and build a deep learning model to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan using historical data.

## Approach to the problem:
I performed the following steps as part of building a deep neural network

1) EDA: Utilized the data imputation techniques to deal with the null values, duplicates and data pre processing as part of EDA.

2) Feature engineering: Used feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful dataset and used SMOTE analysis to balance the dataset.

3) Feature encoding: Used encoding techniques to encode the categorical values.

4) DL Model: Build deep learning model using keras and tensorflow to predict the outcome.
